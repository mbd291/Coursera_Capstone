    "This report presents the development of a support system, to help clients that want to move for another city, and do not know in which neighborhood should they live. \n",
    "\n",
    "As example, it was simulated three ficticious clients, who want to move from New York to Toronto. For each client, a logistic regression model was developed, based on their preferences on living in New York. \n",
    "\n",
    "These models were applied to predict the clients satisfaction on living in Toronto, according to the chosen neighborhood to live.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was possible to identify neighborhoods with a likelihood above 75% of client satisfaction. Conversely, it was also possible to verify the neighborhoods where clients would not be happy living there, with likelihoods lower than 40% of satisfaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to narrow development time, the developed system is just a prototype. There are room for improvements. But it shows that the goals and requirements can be obtained, when more time is invested, mainly in client profiles. \n"
